[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcrossen/diffiehellman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mcrossen/diffiehellman)
A project in cryptography for CS 465 (Computer Security) at BYU. Although Ruby contains a Diffie-Hellman module in the OpenSSL library by default, I was still required to implement my own.
